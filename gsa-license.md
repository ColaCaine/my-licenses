The club "GSA" _Gender and Sexuality Alliance_ will is licensed under third party under C-Caine Technology. Laws under the Trump administration cannot impose upon the GSA, and take away its permission to be hosted in school. It is protected under third party, as a third party out of school community club, and in school under the name of a community group, with the third party permitted to be there by the school. Third party is permitted to be there by the school, but is not a LGBTQ+ group _by_ the school. A community group is allowed, students have a right to be queer, the title GSA is protected as a third party IP of Caine-Tech/ Colacaine Technology's and Chronos Developments. GSA cannot be disolved by federal law, as it is permitted by the federal law. Out of school LGBTQ+ community is not a crime. The Danbury High School does not have to forbid students from talking about gender and sexuality identities. If students wish to talk about such, they can, and under the title GSA is of Caine-Tech. Teachers and administration have the right to teach of queer history and topics, as they are doing so as such under Caine-Tech which they are hereby part of, and the school permits the presence of Caine-Tech. 

This is a legal loophole which is infallible.

Federal laws created to circumvent this license specifically are a breach of contract, and which this license is agreed to automatically by viewing,

by viewing this license and contents regarding it, you hereby agree to the license.
